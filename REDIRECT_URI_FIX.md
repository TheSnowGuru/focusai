# ðŸ”§ Redirect URI Fix Applied

## What Was Wrong

1. **Dynamic Extension ID** - Code was using `chrome.runtime.id` which changes between installations
2. **Redirect URI Mismatch** - Generated URI didn't match Spotify Dashboard
3. **Login Button Hidden** - View toggle logic kept login screen hidden

## What Was Fixed

### âœ… Hardcoded Redirect URI in All Files

**Before:**
```javascript
const extensionId = chrome.runtime.id;
const redirectUri = `https://${extensionId}.chromiumapp.org/callback`;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const redirectUri = 'https://fcebfginidcappmbokiokjpgjfbmadbj.chromiumapp.org/callback';
```

### Files Updated:
1. âœ… `popup.js` - Line 417 (initAuthHandlers) and Line 489 (loginWithSpotify)
2. âœ… `background.js` - Line 23 (spotifyAuth)
3. âœ… `debug.html` - Line 171 (loadInfo)

## Redirect URI to Use

Add this EXACTLY to your Spotify Dashboard:

```
https://fcebfginidcappmbokiokjpgjfbmadbj.chromiumapp.org/callback
```

### How to Add it:

1. Go to: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Open your app
3. Click "Edit Settings"
4. Scroll to "Redirect URIs"
5. Paste: `https://fcebfginidcappmbokiokjpgjfbmadbj.chromiumapp.org/callback`
6. Click "Add"
7. Click "Save"

## Testing

### 1. Reload Extension
```
chrome://extensions â†’ Find FocusAI â†’ Click reload icon
```

### 2. Open Debug Panel
```
chrome-extension://fcebfginidcappmbokiokjpgjfbmadbj/debug.html
```

Should now show correct redirect URI!

### 3. Test Login
1. Click extension icon
2. Should see login screen
3. Redirect URI should be visible and correct
4. Click "Login with Spotify"
5. Should work! âœ…

## Storage Permission

Already in `manifest.json`:
```json
"permissions": ["alarms", "notifications", "storage", "offscreen", "tabs", "scripting", "identity"]
```

Storage permission is line 10 âœ…

## Current Status

ðŸŸ¢ **ALL FIXED**
- Redirect URI hardcoded
- Debug panel shows correct URI
- Login button visible when not authenticated
- Storage permission present

Ready to test! ðŸš€
