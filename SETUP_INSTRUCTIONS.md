# üöÄ FocusAI Setup Instructions

## ‚úÖ Critical: Spotify Dashboard Setup

### Step 1: Add Redirect URI to Spotify Dashboard

1. Go to: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Login with your Spotify account
3. Click on your app (or create one if you don't have it)
4. Click **"Edit Settings"**
5. Scroll to **"Redirect URIs"**
6. Add this EXACT URI:
   ```
   https://fcebfginidcappmbokiokjpgjfbmadbj.chromiumapp.org/callback
   ```
7. Click **"Add"**
8. Scroll down and click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Verify Client ID

Make sure your app uses this Client ID:
```
13b4d04efb374d83892efa41680c4a3b
```

If it's different, update it in:
- `popup.js` (line ~487)
- `background.js` (line 1)

## üîß Extension Installation

### Step 1: Load Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome
2. Go to: `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **"Developer mode"** (toggle in top right)
4. Click **"Load unpacked"**
5. Select the `/Users/shay/Documents/GitHub/focus` folder
6. Extension should now appear with the ID: `fcebfginidcappmbokiokjpgjfbmadbj`

### Step 2: Verify Extension ID

**IMPORTANT**: The extension ID MUST be `fcebfginidcappmbokiokjpgjfbmadbj` to match the redirect URI.

If it's different:
1. Uninstall the extension
2. Delete the extension folder
3. Re-clone or re-download
4. Load unpacked again

The ID is determined by the first installation, so you may need to:
- Pack the extension with a specific key
- OR update all redirect URIs to match the new ID

## üß™ Testing

### Step 1: Open Debug Panel

Open this URL in Chrome:
```
chrome-extension://fcebfginidcappmbokiokjpgjfbmadbj/debug.html
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Redirect URI: `https://fcebfginidcappmbokiokjpgjfbmadbj.chromiumapp.org/callback`
- ‚ùå Not Authenticated (initially)

### Step 2: Test Login

1. Click the FocusAI extension icon
2. You should see either:

   - **Timer screen** (if already authenticated)
3. If you see the login screen:
   - Verify the redirect URI matches
   - Click "Login with Spotify"
   - Approve permissions
   - Should redirect back and show timer

### Step 3: Check Console

Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
üîê Starting Spotify login...

Redirect URI: https://fcebfginidcappmbokiokjpgjfbmadbj.chromiumapp.org/callback
üåê Opening Spotify authorization...
‚úÖ Received redirect URL: [...]

‚úÖ Successfully received access token
‚úÖ Token saved to storage
‚úÖ Login complete!
```
